### Usage  

All of the cli tools communicates using network sockets, so to use cli tools you must run the fileserver, to start fileserver run following command

```bash
> tpi-manage manage
```
Now start fileserver from manager GUI. To share files over the internet you'll need to run the tunnel service you can also run the tunnel service using manager GUI.

To add a file in sharing list run tpi-add with file name and it'll generate a unique token that can be used for sharing the file over the internet.

```bash
> tpi-add hello.jpg
[+] file            : /home/user/images/hello.jpg
[+] filename        : hello.jpg
[+] local           : False
[+] md5             : 84442a0496d176cc208dd1af8b15193b
[+] time            : 2020-10-22 13:49:54
[+] token           : Bp9500
[+] type            : 1
[+] url             : https://transferpi.tk/token/Bp9500
```

To download files using generated tokens use tpi-get.

```bash 
> tpi-get Bp9500
