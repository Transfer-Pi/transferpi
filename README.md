After setting up transferpi, run following command to download config

```bash
$ tpi-manage login
```

This will take you to transferpi's login page, You can login or create account using your google account. After signing up it'll redirect you to config page where you save or download config file.

### Usage  

All of the cli tools communicates using network sockets, so to use cli tools you must run the fileserver, to start fileserver run following command

```bash
$ tpi-manage start fileserver
```

To share files over the internet you'll need to run the tunnel service you can also run the tunnel service using tpi-manage.

```bash
$ tpi-manage start tunnel
```

To add a file in sharing list run tpi-add with file name and it'll generate a unique token that can be used for sharing the file over the internet.

```bash
$ tpi-add hello.jpg
[+] file            : /home/user/images/hello.jpg
[+] filename        : hello.jpg
[+] local           : False
[+] md5             : 84442a0496d176cc208dd1af8b15193b
[+] time            : 2020-10-22 13:49:54
[+] token           : Bp9500
[+] type            : 1
[+] url             : https://transferpi.tk/token/Bp9500
```

To download files using generated tokens use tpi-get.

```bash 
$ tpi-get Bp9500
[*] Starting Donwnload : hello.jpg
[*] |▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉|

```

### How does it work.

> Creating share token

> Downloading file

![](./doc/images/download-tpi-get.jpg)

### Private file sharing

To share files privately use `-t=0` when adding the file. It'll add the file only to the local database. The file won't be downloadable using normal HTTP protocols or any kind of browsers.
```bash
> tpi-add file -t=0
```
To share a private file you might need to allow other host to access the private file. To do this you'll need to add the other host's public key to allowed hosts in your config file. To do this run following command.

```bash
> tpi-manage host add=public_key
```

Replace public_key with other host's public key.

To download this file other user might need to specify file host using `-H=host_name`.

```bash
> tpi-get UEIE -H=host_name
```
