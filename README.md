To add a file in sharing list run tpi-add with file name and it'll generate a unique token that can be used for sharing the file over the internet.

```bash
$ tpi-add hello.jpg
[+] file            : /home/user/images/hello.jpg
[+] filename        : hello.jpg
[+] local           : False
[+] md5             : 84442a0496d176cc208dd1af8b15193b
[+] time            : 2020-10-22 13:49:54
[+] token           : Bp9500
[+] type            : 1
[+] url             : https://transferpi.tk/token/Bp9500
```
